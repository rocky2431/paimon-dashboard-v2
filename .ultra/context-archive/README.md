# Context Archive

This directory stores compressed context from long development sessions.

## Purpose

When context usage exceeds thresholds, completed tasks are archived here to free up space for new work.

## Archive Format

`session-{timestamp}.md`

Each archive contains:
- Session summary
- Completed tasks
- Key decisions made
- Files modified

## Recovery

To resume from an archived session, reference the session file in your prompt.
